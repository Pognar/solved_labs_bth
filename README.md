## Compiler lab3 for minijava
For compiler 3, refer to the makefile
run make all for all testcases, the output from interpreting A.java is not correct due to how we handle boolean values in the value stack.
Feel free to push a fix

## Operating system lab3
Run the make, then ./filesystem, then format and it will work as intended
